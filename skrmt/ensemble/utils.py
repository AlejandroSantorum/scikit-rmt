    It illustrates the histogram of the spectrum of a given random matrix ensemble

    This function simulates the histogramming of a given random matrix ensemble
    in its standard form and it compares the former with the equivalent histogram
    computed using the tridiagonal matrix form. This is useful to illustrate both
    types of matrix have the same spectral distribution.

    Args:
        ensemble (_Ensemble): a random matrix ensemble instance. The only supported types
            are `GaussianEnsemble` and `WishartEnsemble`, since spectral optimizations
            based on their tridiagonal forms are known.

        random_state (int, default=None): random seed to initialize the pseudo-random
                number generator of numpy. This has to be any integer between 0 and 2**32 - 1
                (inclusive), or None (default). If None, the seed is obtained from the clock.
