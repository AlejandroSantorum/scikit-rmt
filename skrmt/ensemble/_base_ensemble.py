        Calculates the histogram of the current sampled matrix eigenvalues. Some ensembles
        like Gaussian (Hermite) ensemble or Wishart (Laguerre) ensemble might have
        improved routines to avoid calculating the eigenvalues, so instead the histogram
        is built using certain techniques to boost efficiency.
        It is important to underline that this function works with real eigenvalues,
        if the matrix eigenvalues are complex, they are casted to its real part.

        Args:
            bins (int or sequence): If bins is an integer, it defines the number of
                equal-width bins in the range. If bins is a sequence, it defines the
                bin edges, including the left edge of the first bin and the right
                edge of the last bin; in this case, bins may be unequally spaced.
            interval (tuple): Delimiters (xmin, xmax) of the histogram.
                The lower and upper range of the bins. Lower and upper outliers are ignored.
            density (bool, default=False): If True, draw and return a probability
                density: each bin will display the bin's raw count divided by the total
                number of counts and the bin width, so that the area under the histogram
                integrates to 1. If set to False, the absolute frequencies of the eigenvalues
                are returned.
            norm_const (float, default=None): Eigenvalue normalization constant. By default,
                it is set to None, so eigenvalues are not normalized. However, it is advisable
                to specify a normalization constant to observe eigenvalue spectrum, e.g.
                1/sqrt(n/2) if you want to analyze Wigner's Semicircular Law.
            avoid_img (bool, default=False): If True, eigenvalue imaginary part is ignored.
                This should be used when the eigenvalue compatation is expected to generate
                complex eigenvalues with really small imaginary part because of computing
                rounding errors. E.g.: MANOVA Ensemble eigenvalues.

        Returns:
            (tuple) tuple containing:
                observed (array): List of eigenvalues frequencies per bin. If density is
                True these values are the relative frequencies in order to get an area under
                the histogram equal to 1. Otherwise, this list contains the absolute
                frequencies of the eigenvalues.
                bins (array): The edges of the bins. Length nbins + 1 (nbins left edges and
                right edge of last bin)

        Raises:
            ValueError if interval is not a tuple.
